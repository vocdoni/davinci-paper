\subsection{Interplanetary file system (IPFS)}
\label{sec:background:ipfs}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Brief introduction to IPFS.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ethereum}
\label{sec:background:ethereum}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ethereum blockchain (say transactions have a cost fee).
	\item Ethereum smart contracts.
	
	\textit{Ethereum smart contracts are employed to orchestrate the voting process, manage state transitions, and store critical data, such as the current state root and encryption public keys. These smart contracts provide a trustless environment, ensuring that all participants can be confident that the voting process rules are correctly enforced.}
	
	\item Ethereum data blobs.
	
	\textit{EIP-4844 is used for data availability, enabling the storage of state transition data in the form of Ethereum data blobs. This mechanism allows sequencers to collaborate on the construction and verification of the voting process state, ensuring efficient and decentralized data availability.}
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Zero-knowledge proofs}
\label{sec:background:zkp}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce ZK-SNARKs.
	\item Introduce arithmetic circuits (arithmetic circuit satisfiability).
\end{itemize}
