In this section, we detail the cryptographic primitives used in Section~\ref{sec:vocdoni-protocol}. We briefly introduce elliptic curves, hash functions, Merkle trees, encryption schemes, and proof systems used in the protocol. We also specify at each step the concrete parameters with which each of the primitives is instantiated.\\

\martai{Maybe it should go under the protocol section?}

%\paragraph{Notation.} Throughout the document, we use the following conventions. Given a set $S$, we denote sampling an element $x$ uniformly at random from $S$ by $x \sample S$. We denote all bitstrings of arbitrary length by $\{0,1\}^*$. 
%Any group $\G$ used is of a large prime order, and we assume that the discrete logarithm problem is hard in $\G$. If two elements are denoted by the same letter in upper and lower case, e.g. $a, A$, this often means that $A$ is a public key corresponding to the secret key $a$. 
%$\F_p$ denotes de finite field of order $p$, and $\F_p^* = \F_p/\{0\}$.

\subsection{Elliptic curves}
\label{sec:cryptographic-primitives:elliptic-curves}

\Davinci relies on multiple elliptic curves to ensure interoperability with Ethereum, compatibility with available cryptographic primitives, and efficient in-circuit operations. On the one hand, SECP256K1~\cite{brown10sec} is used because Ethereum public keys are elements of this curve. As \Davinci assumes each voter holds a standard Ethereum address, cryptographic operations such as digital signatures and identity verification rely on SECP256K1 to match the Ethereum ecosystem. On the other hand, BN254~\cite{jancar20bn256} is chosen because it is the curve supported by Ethereum's precompiled contracts for zero-knowledge proof verification, which makes it ideal for verifying SNARK proofs on-chain with minimal gas cost. then, BabyJubjub~\cite{belles21twisted} is used as an inner curve for elliptic curve operations within arithmetic circuits. Finally, BLS12-377~\cite{bowe20zexe} and BW6-761~\cite{elhousni20optimized} are used to enable recursive proof composition. More specifically, BLS12-377 acts as the inner curve for constructing proofs, while BW6-761 serves as the outer curve that verifies those proofs within larger zkSNARK circuits. This pairing enables succinct verification and composability of zkSNARKs within other zkSNARKs, which we use for \davinci’s aggregation and state transition logic. Below, we give the details of these curves.

\subsection{Hash functions}
\label{sec:cryptographic-primitives:hash}

\martai{Poseidon? Specify parameters? And $p$ may actually not be $p$, and probably it will be instantiated with different curves, depending on the circuit.}

We use three hash functions. 

\paragraph{Keccak256.} On the one side, the Keccak256~\cite{bertoni11keccak} hash function $\hlset{\Keccak} : \F_p \rightarrow \F_p$ is used to derive an Ethereum address from a public key over $\SEC{\G}$ (as described in~\cite{wood2014ethereum}).

\paragraph{Poseidon.} On the other side, the hash function we use the most is Poseidon~\cite{grassi21poseidon} hash function $\hlset{\Poseidon} : \F_p \rightarrow \F_p$, where $\F_p$ is the set of tuples of $\F_p$-elements of any length, and $\F_p$ is the field described in Section~\ref{sec:cryptographic-primitives:elliptic-curves}. In particular, we make use of the \textsc{Poseidon-128} permutation \[\pi: \F_p^t\rightarrow \F_p^t,\] where $t=r+c$, with the following parameters:
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c | }
			\hline
			Rate & Capacity  & Full rounds & Partial rounds & S-box \\
			\hline
			$r=4$ & $c=1$ & $R_F=8$ & $R_P=59$ & $S(x)=x^5$ \\
			\hline		
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

% \begin{itemize}
	% 	\item Rate $r=4$.
	% 	\item Capacity $c=1$. 
	% 	\item Full rounds $R_F = 8$.
	% 	\item Partial rounds $R_P = 59$.
	% 	\item S-box: $S(x) = x^5$.
	% \end{itemize}

\paragraph{MiMC-7.} Finally, we use the MiMC-7 hash function~\cite{albrecht16mimc} $\hlset{\Mimc} : \F_p \rightarrow \F_p$, where $\F_p$ is the set of tuples of $\F_p$-elements of any length, and $\F_p$ is the field described in Section~\ref{sec:cryptographic-primitives:elliptic-curves}. This hash is used to hash the public inputs of the different circuits and verify the associated proofs more efficiently (see Section~\ref{sec:vocdoni-protocol:circuits} for further details).

For the sake of clarity, in our notation we admit anything as an input of the above hash functions, although it might not be parsed as a sequence of $\F_p$-elements. Any bitstring can be converted to a tuple of $\F_p$-elements, so this does not change the actual working of the hash computation. In this document, is implied that the proper conversion happens before feeding the input into the actual hash function.

%\subsection{Commitment schemes}
%\label{sec:cryptographic-primitives:commitments}

%Pedersen commitment scheme~\cite{pedersen1991non}. 

\subsection{Encryption schemes}
\label{sec:cryptographic-primitives:encryption}

\textit{Old text: Threshold homomorphic encryption, specifically the ElGamal scheme, is used to allow the summation of encrypted votes without decrypting them. This enables the system to compute the final vote tally while maintaining the privacy of individual votes. By ensuring that no vote is exposed during the aggregation phase, this scheme preserves voter confidentiality and provides anti-coercion protection, as voters cannot prove their choice to a third party once an encrypted vote is added.}\\

ElGamal [CITE].

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Map $\msg$ to $\J$ via $M = mG$. (link G).
				\item Select a random scalar $k \sample $.
				\item Compute $C_1 = k \cdot G \in \J$.
				\item Compute $C_2 = k \cdot \pk + M \in \J$. 
				\item Output $\enc = (C_1, C_2) \in \J^2$.

				%From a ciphertext (C,D) calculate C′=xC, and retrieve the point Pm with Pm=D−C′=(k(xP)+Pm)−(x(kP)). Then calculate the message m with f−1(Pm).

				\item Output $\msg = C_2 - K$. 
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{minipage}
\end{mdframed}

\martai{The group $\J$ is not the right group. This should be changed after writing the elliptic curves section. Actually, I am unsure we should specify where do all elements live.}

\martai{It remains to explain how to recover $m$ from $M$. I propose to define a function $P_m$ that maps $m$ to $\J$, and then say that although it is generally not invertible, in this case the message space is small, and therefore, it can be done via brute-force search or using the baby-step giant-step algorithm [CITE].}

Note that this scheme is additively homomorphic. That is, given two ciphertexts $(C_1, C_2)$ and $(C_1', C_2')$, their component-wise addition yields: $(C_1^{sum}, C_2^{sum}) = (C_1 + C_1', C_2, C_2)$. The aggregated ciphertext decrypts to the sum of the messages $M^{sum} = M_1 + M_2$.

\martai{The $pk$ used to encrypt is generated by multiple parties as defined in Section~\ref{sec:cryptographic-primitives:dkg}.}

\martai{Add reencryption algorithm, which essentially adds $\Enc(0)$: $\Enc(v) = \Enc(v + 0) = \Enc(v) + \Enc(0)$.}

\subsection{Digital signature schemes}
\label{sec:cryptographic-primitives:signatures}

%\Davinci uses the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)~\cite{johnson01ecdsa} over the SECP256K1 curve for user authentication and vote authorization. This decision is taken to ensure that \davinci is compatible with standard Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask~\ref{} or Ledger~\ref{}, without requiring users to generate or manage additional cryptographic keys. 
%
Verification of ECDSA signatures is \textit{performed inside} zero-knowledge proofs using a specialized circuit that emulates SECP256K1 arithmetic. This approach is necessary because SECP256K1 is defined over a 256-bit prime field that differs from the native field used in the ZK-SNARK circuit (see Section\ref{sec:vocdoni-protocol:circuits} for more details). Below, we describe the algorithms, which follow the standard ECDSA protocol.

				\item Set $r = x_R \bmod q$. If $r = 0$, go back to step~\ref{item:ssign-step}. 
				\item Compute $s = k^{-1} \cdot (h + r \cdot \sk) \bmod q.$ If $s = 0$, go back to step~\ref{item:ssign-step}.

		\end{itemize}
	\end{minipage}
\end{mdframed}


\subsection{Key generation schemes}
\label{sec:cryptographic-primitives:dkg}

\textit{Old text: The DKG protocol is used to generate the encryption public key (EPK) in a decentralized manner. Sequencers collaboratively participate in the DKG process to create the EPK, ensuring that no single party has full control over the key. This approach guarantees that the encryption key remains secure and that decryption of results is only possible when a threshold number of sequencers publish their shares.}\\

We use the distributed key generation (DKG) protocol that allows a group of participants to jointly generate a pair of public/private keys for the ElGamal cryptosystem [CITE]. Each participant holds a share of the private key, and only a threshold number of participants can collaborate to decrypt messages. 

\martai{We use a variation of DKG because of the encryption of shares. Below I described the original functions but they should be changed!}
\martai{Mention that in the SC participants are listed, that is, they have an associated number $i$.}

Let $t$ be the threshold parameter (minimum number of participants required to decrypt messages) and $n$ the total number of participants participating in the DKG protocol ($t \leq n$). Let $G$ be generator point of order $q$. (This will already be defined in the EC section).

\begin{mdframed}
Each participant $P_i$ will use $\hlget{\GenerateShares}$ to generate their share. Then, they will make the set $\{C_i\}_{i=1}^{t-1}$ publicly available and send each $s_j$ privately to each participant $s_j$. Every participant $P_i$ can verify the share $s_{j,i}$ received from $P_j$ (from of the others) using the algorithm $\hlget{\VerifyShare}$.\\

		\item[$\bullet$] $\hlset{\GenerateShares}(\text{participant $i$})$:  \vspace{0.1cm}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Select random scalars $a_{i,0} \sample \Z_q$.
			\item Define the polynomial $f_i(x) = \sum_{j = 0}^{t-1} a_{i,j} x^{j}$.
			\item For every $j\in\{0,\dots,t-1\}$, compute 
			$$C_{i, j} = a_{i,j}\cdot G.$$
			\item For every $j\in\{1,\dots,n\}$, compute shares 
			$$s_{i, j} = f_i(j).$$

		\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
	\martai{This is not true - according to the specs, shares are encrypted using a simplified version of the EC integrated encryption scheme (ECIES). Each participant generates a zkSNARK proof to prove the correctness of the encrypted shares and compliance of the DKG protocol.
